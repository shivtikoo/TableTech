# TableTech
Table Tech is a restaurant automation system that we created as part of our final project submission for software engineering lab in sixth semester. The project focused less on coding and more on understanding the SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES and creation of GOOD DOCUMENATATION for a software product.
